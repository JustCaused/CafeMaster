# CafeMaster
# Please keep in mind that CafeMaster is still in development. I'm still working on GUI, and I plan to do user overhaul by implementing proper database using JDBC. 
# After I'm satisfied with GUI, I have plans to work on inventory managment, connectivity to Android devices (to be able to order products to selected table, same as on computer) and possibly POS integration if I find a well documented API to connect to a printer.
