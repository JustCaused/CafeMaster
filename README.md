Early Access
Please keep in mind that CafeMaster is still in it's development. I try to do this as a side project and in my free time. I'm still planning to add some more features and work on bug fixes before I can say that I finished working on it. Naturally, some parts are a stuff to change. Thanks.

What is CafeMaster?
CafeMaster is a simple, GUI application that allows it's users to manage their restaurant/bar. Below you can see which functionalities it offers.

What motivated me to make CafeMaster?
I used to work as a bartender/waiter as my summer jobs. I often found it difficult to keep track of who ordered what and what was billed or not. This way, I can keep my notes in a more organized way than using a notepad. Also, knowing how much real world restaurants/bars change, I tried to make an app that is as customizable as possible. I'm more than proud to say that my app was actually used in the real world to temporarily fix problems until the restaurant owners bought the "real" restaurant managment app.

Current functionalities:
- Ability to create/update/remove products that the service offers
- Table managment and billing
- Full customization that allows user's to personalise app to their liking
- App supports multiple users which allows multiple staff members to operate application at the same time
- Users can either be admins (which allows them to edit app settings, maniupulate products and available users)
- Ability to create daily reports which show total expenses and profit along with bought quantity of each product
- Ability to create logs which show user statistics in terms of who ordered what and at what time

What I'm planning to add:
- Inventory managment (being unable to add products if they are unavailable in the inventory as well as warnings if the stock is running low)
- GUI overhaul
- Possible ability to connect an Android device and directly manage tables from your phone
